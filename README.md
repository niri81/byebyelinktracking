# Bye Bye, Link Tracking ðŸ‘‹

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This software is still in early development. See planned features.

Are you a part-time privacy preserver and want to bring your link-sharing to the next level? _Bye bye, link tracking_ has your back (well, actually your link). Because who needs link tracking anyway.

## What does it do?

You probably stumbled across `si` in YouTube links (e.g. <https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0?si=SomeFancyTextHere>) or similar add-ons to links (e.g. [UTM parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters)) at some time already. These additions are not necessary for any functionality but rather allow for tracking link clicks, marketing campaigns, etc.

_Bye bye, link tracking_ is installed as a service on your system that monitors your clipboard. As soon as it identifies a URL in your clipboard that has tracking additions, it automatically replaces the link with a purged version. You manually removing it is not necessary anymore.
